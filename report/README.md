### Project Description
The project would analyze different datasets of personality traits of various people of different personality types.
Those personality traits would be used to determine the personality of those people through their social media.
Through this, we would be able to predict if the personality type of the person in real life matches that of their personality on social media.


### Project question or hypotheis
Can social media presence accurately predict whether an individual exhibits primarily introverted or extroverted personality traits?
