# Final Project Guidelines

Your final project is a team-based, end-to-end data science project that brings together everything you've learned in this course. You'll select a theme, analyze a real dataset, and present your findings as a cohesive, data-driven story.

---

## Project Goals

- Apply core data science techniques to a real-world problem
- Conduct EDA and build basic predictive models
- Tell a compelling, insightful narrative through data
- Practice collaboration, documentation, and public presentation

---
## Choose a Theme

All projects must align with one of the following themes:
- Violence & Conflict
- Environmental Issues
---

## Project Guideline
- Choose one dataset aligned with a theme
- Form a clear question or hypothesis
- Document your data-cleaning decisions
- Build visualizations and, if possible, a basic model
- Tell a compelling data story with your data
---


## Timeline & Milestones

### Week 1: Final Project Team Forming
- Form teams of 2–3 members
### Week 3: Final Project Proposal
- Begin your project work:
  - Form Project question or hypotheis. See example here: [`01_QuestionForming.md`](01_QuestionsForming.md)
  - Select one of the dataset from [`data/02_datasets.md`](02_datasets.md)
### Week 5: Final Project Development
  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Build and evaluate a machine learning model (if applicable)
  - Create charts, maps, and other visualizations
### Week 8: Final Project Showcase
- Write key findings and data narrative
- Prepare presentation slides and summary key talking points
- Present your project (10 minutes per team)
- Participate in live Q&A with classmates
- Receive instructor feedback
- Reflect on what you learned and what you'd improve
- Discuss how to use this project in portfolios/resumes

- Submit the following:
   - [ ] `final_notebook.ipynb`: Cleaned, well-commented notebook with code, EDA, and model inside the `notebooks/` folder
   - [ ] `data/`: Folder with original or cleaned dataset (CSV preferred)
   - [ ] `final_presentation.pdf` or `.pptx`: Slides used in your presentation inside the `report/` folder
   - [ ] `README.md`: Brief overview of your project, dataset, and findings inside the `report/` folder   
   - [ ] `team_contribtuions.md`: who did what inside the `report/` folder
   - [ ] `team_reflections.md`: What worked, what didn’t, what you learned inside the `report/` folder
