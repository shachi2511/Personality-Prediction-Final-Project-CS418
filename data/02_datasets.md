# ðŸ“Š Course Datasets & Themes

In this course, students will explore two critical global issues through real-world data:

- **Theme 1: Violence & Conflict**
- **Theme 2: Environmental Issues**

Each team will choose one of these themes for their final project and use a provided dataset (or closely related alternative) to develop insights, build visualizations, and train predictive models.

## Theme 1: Violence & Conflict Analysis (ACLED)

The **Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)** offers a detailed, geocoded dataset on political violence and protest events across the globe.

### ðŸ”— Dataset:
- [ACLED Data Portal](https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/)
- Formats: CSV, Excel (updated weekly)
- Typical Features:
  - Event type (e.g. battle, riot, protest)
  - Location (country, region, coordinates)
  - Actor names (state, non-state, civilians)
  - Fatalities
  - Event date

### âœ… Possible Projects:
- Trend analysis of violent conflict over time in a region
- Predicting protest activity based on event types
- Mapping hotspots of political violence using geospatial visualizations
- Comparing protest patterns before/after major political events

## Theme 2: Environmental Issues & Sustainability

This theme focuses on climate, pollution, biodiversity, and sustainability challenges using environmental datasets.

### ðŸ”— Suggested Datasets:

#### 1. Global Air Pollution
- [WHO Ambient Air Pollution Data](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution)
- [OpenAQ Global Air Quality](https://openaq.org/#/)

#### 2. Deforestation & Land Use
- [Global Forest Watch](https://data.globalforestwatch.org/)
- [MODIS Land Cover](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd12q1v006/)

#### 3. Climate Change Metrics
- [NOAA Climate Data Online](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)
- [Berkeley Earth Climate Data](http://berkeleyearth.org/data/)

#### 4. COâ‚‚ Emissions
- [Our World in Data CO2](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

### âœ… Possible Projects:
- Analyzing trends in PM2.5 air pollution across cities
- Predicting deforestation risk from satellite data
- Correlating temperature anomalies with industrial activity
- Visualizing climate risk across global regions
